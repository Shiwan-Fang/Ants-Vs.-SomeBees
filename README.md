It is a project from course cs61a

The project involves creating a tower defense game, Ants Vs. SomeBees, 
where brave ants defend their queen from invading bees by throwing leaves to defeat them.
Inspired by Plants Vs. Zombies, the objective is to protect the queen and repel the airborne attackers.

the basic structure and gui were already offered by the course.
I contributed in the ant.py part, writing various functions about different ants. 

This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm.
The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.
