It is a project from course cs61a

The project involves creating a tower defense game, Ants Vs. SomeBees, 
where brave ants defend their queen from invading bees by throwing leaves to defeat them.
Inspired by Plants Vs. Zombies, the objective is to protect the queen and repel the airborne attackers.

The basic structure and gui were already offered by the course.

What I do in this project, specifically in ant.py:
  
  Define Game Mechanics: Write classes and functions to model ants, bees, and other game components, including their behaviors and interactions.
  
  Implement Strategy Logic: Develop logic for ants to attack bees and bees to invade the colony, ensuring the game rules are followed.
  
  Manage Game State: Handle the flow of the game, including turns, health, and victory or defeat conditions.
  
  Add and Test Features: Introduce specialized ants with unique abilities and test their functionality through provided scenarios.
  
  Optimize Code: Ensure the program runs efficiently and adheres to best practices.

This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm.
